# Controllerly-UI
Intuitive Smartphone Gamepad User Interface for Controllerly.

The front-end leverages pure HTML power to save energy and be as thin as possible.

## Custom Layouts
The Gamepad Layout component is configured with a Layout Configuration. It allows the easy setup of grid based input systems.
The layout configuration can split views in half and provides a divider option that allows users to dynamically adjust button sizes.
